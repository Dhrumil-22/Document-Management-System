## 🏆 Hackathon Details
- Event: Hackovate
- Track: AI / Responsible Tech


## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a *content moderation system* designed to automatically detect and filter *NSFW (Not Safe For Work)* text and images.  
It helps platforms maintain a safe environment by preventing inappropriate content from being uploaded or displayed.  

Built for *hackathons*, the system is lightweight, extendable, and easy to integrate with any web or mobile application.

## ⚡ Features
- 📝 *Text Moderation* – Detects offensive, abusive, or adult content in text.
- 🖼 *Image Moderation* – Identifies NSFW or explicit content in uploaded images.
- ⚙ *REST API* – Exposes moderation endpoints for integration with frontends.
- 🎨 *Frontend Integration* – Demo frontend with Axios for text/image checks.
- 📊 *Scalable* – Can be extended with advanced ML models or external APIs.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- *Frontend:* React.js (with Axios for API calls)  
- *Backend:* FastAPI (Python)  
- *Machine Learning / Models:*  
  - Pre-trained NSFW detection models (e.g., nsfw_model for images)  
  - Text classification filters (for bad/offensive words detection)  
- *Database (Optional):* SQLite / MongoDB (for logs & analytics)  
- *Deployment:* Docker / Localhost (for hackathon demo)

👉 This README is *plug-and-play*. You’ll just need to:  
- Change *repo link*  
- Update *hackathon name & team members*  
- Add any *specific models/APIs* you’re using  

Would you like me to also prepare a *short version* of this README (1-page style), so you can paste it directly in your hackathon submission form without the long details?

- Duration: 24/48 hrs
- Project Type: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
